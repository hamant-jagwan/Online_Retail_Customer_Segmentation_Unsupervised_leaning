## 1️⃣ What is the actual problem statement?

    Your dataset contains transactions of customers for an online retail store, and your task is:

    “Identify major customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.”

    Breaking it down:

    You have raw transaction data: invoices, quantities, unit prices, dates, customer IDs, etc.

    No labels exist (like “good” or “bad” customer).

    The goal is to group customers into meaningful clusters based on patterns in the data, such as:

    How often they buy (Frequency)

    How recently they bought (Recency)

    How much they spend (Monetary)

Formally:

    Type of problem: Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)

    Objective: Discover natural groupings in customer behavior.

## What will the outcome provide you?

    After performing segmentation, you will get:

    Clusters of customers

    Each cluster represents a customer segment with similar buying behavior.

    Example segments could be:

    High-Value Frequent Buyers: Buy often, spend a lot.

    Occasional Big Spenders: Buy rarely but spend a lot each time.

    Low-Value Buyers: Buy small quantities infrequently.

    One-Time Buyers: Only purchased once.

    Insights for business strategy

    Marketing campaigns can be customized per segment.

    Loyalty programs can target high-value customers.

    Special promotions for inactive or low-value customers to increase engagement.

    Visual and analytical output

    Cluster profiles: mean/median Recency, Frequency, Monetary for each segment.

    Plots like RFM distribution per cluster or 2D PCA/t-SNE visualization of clusters.

## methodology:
### ML algorithms: 
* KMeans
* DBSCAN
* Hierarchical clustering

### Cluster Validation / Evaluation Techniques: 
* Elbow method → only for K-Means (and similar).
* Silhouette score → works for K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical (and almost any clustering algorithm).
